A clone of YouTube built with React and Redux.

[View the demo](https://youtube-clone-react-redux.herokuapp.com/)

## Technology
* React 16
* Redux
* Jest and Enzyme
* SCSS
* Bootstrap 4
* Fully responsive

## Running Locally

1) Rename "example.env" in the root to simply ".env" and paste in your YouTube V3 API key.

2) Navigate to the root and install all dependencies by running:
```
npm install
```

3) Start the server and watch for file changes by running:
```
npm start
```
Changes to JavaScript files will cause the server to automatically restart and your browser to refresh. Changes to SCSS files will trigger instant compilation with the resulting CSS being injected into the page live without requiring a refresh.

## Testing

To run the tests, run:
```
npm test
```
